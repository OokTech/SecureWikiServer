description: Create and serve new wikis from inside a wiki.

''Note:'' This is about how to create and start serving a new wiki. If you want
to add an existing wiki to the list of wikis served than you should refer to
[[starting other wikis|$:/plugins/OokTech/MultiUser/Starting Other Wikis]].

To create a new wiki go to the `Node Settings` tab of the $:/ControlPanel and
scroll down below the settings interface to where it says you can create a new
wiki.

Select the edition you want to use as the base and then give the wiki a name
in the text field, then click the `Make Wiki` button.

After that the new wiki should be available on `localhost:8080/WikiName`
(assuming you called the wiki WikiName and your wiki is served on port 8080
using the default settings). If you are not on the computer running the server
or have changed the settings than the url is the url of your root wiki with
`/WikiName` added to the end.
